# Paired-Via-Sde

We implement a Score-based Generative Model to perform image-to-image translations from an image domain A to an image domain B and vice versa. 
Domain A consists of satellite images. Domain B consists of the corresponding maps style images. 

### Results:
|1st column: Satellite Images / 2nd column: Actual / 3rd row: Ours (generated by conditional samplers)|

### Dataset
The model was trained on the Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction dataset [link](https://drive.grand-challenge.org/).

### Training
To set the parameters edit the config.py file and then run the main.py file. Alternatively, a jupyter notebook implementation(main.ipynb) is also provided for training the CycleGAN model.
