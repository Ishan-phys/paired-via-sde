# Paired-Via-Sde

We implement a Score-based Generative Model to perform image-to-image translations from an image domain A to an image domain B and vice versa. 
Domain A consists of satellite images. Domain B consists of the corresponding maps style images. 

### Results:
|1st column: Input Images / 2nd column: Ours (generated by conditional samplers) / 3rd column: Actual |

### Dataset
The model was trained on the Maps dataset [link](http://efrosgans.eecs.berkeley.edu/pix2pix/datasets/).

### Training
To set the parameters edit the config.py file and then run the code as given in the main.ipynb notebook file.
